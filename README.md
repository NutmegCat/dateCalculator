# **Days Calculator**
<br></br>
## Objective
---
<br></br>

- Write a method `dayNumber` that determines the number of days in a year up to and including the current day. The method should have three int parameters: `year`, `month`, and `day`. If the value of any parameter is invalid, the method should print a warning message and return the value zero. The table gives some examples of the action of the method. Accept any non-negative year as being valid. You may want to assume the existence of a method `numberOfDays` that returns the number of days in a given month of a given year.

- Has In.java
- Used Java version 1.2 ~~(*is updated though*)~~
